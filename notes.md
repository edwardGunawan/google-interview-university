## Mistake from beginning
----------------------------
### What I should have done for each topic:
1. Watch a couple of hours of videos on the topic, to get the main idea
2. implement the algorithms and data structures
3. make flashcards for important things I should remember about the topic
4. Move one to the next topic
5. review the flash card when you have time
6. after a few days, watch another video about the topic, perhaps 30
mins or so
7. after another week, watch a video about the topic, maybe same video or shorter
8. keep reviewing flash cards


## Review Algorithms and Data Structure
------------------------------
1. write them down in the paper
2. each one fit one page
3. you don't really need to memorize them, just know the concepts
and how they work in case you need to recreate them in an interview


-----------
# Important Point
- Jump through various topic, and get back again the other day.
- Solve at least 1 algorithm questions
- Write it down while watching the video.
- The pattern will be watch movie -- implement algorithm -- (if have the time) 
 implement a data structure
- Will be doing thing one day and the other day will be doing front end interview
    questions

- [ ] [MVVM](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvvm)

- Asside from JS design pattern, its good to know some JS framework,
    * You ahve to know when and why frontend team uses frameworks
    * if you are interviewing for React+Flux or an Angular position, review some of the documentation and architecture of the framwork.
