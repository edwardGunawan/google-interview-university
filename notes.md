## Mistake from beginning
----------------------------
### What I should have done for each topic:
* Watch a couple of hours of videos on the topic, to get the main idea
* implement the algorithms and data structures
* make flashcards for important things I should remember about the topic
* Move one to the next topic
* review the flash card when you have time
* after a few days, watch another video about the topic, perhaps 30
mins or so
* after another week, watch a video about the topic, maybe same video or shorter
* keep reviewing flash cards


## Review Algorithms and Data Structure
------------------------------
* write them down in the paper
* each one fit one page
* you don't really need to memorize them, just know the concepts
and how they work in case you need to recreate them in an interview


-----------
# Important Point
* Jump through various topic, and get back again the other day.
* Solve at least 1 algorithm questions
* Write it down while watching the video.
* The pattern will be watch movie -- implement algorithm -- (if have the time) 
 implement a data structure
* Will be doing thing one day and the other day will be doing front end interview
    questions
